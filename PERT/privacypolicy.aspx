        <h3><a id="public"></a>What is our privacy policy for the public ordering website?</h3>
        <p>
            We do not collect personal information about visitors unless they 
    choose to give us information about themselves. We keep contact information up to 90 days for individuals who contact us or place orders, in order to follow up if necessary. For 
    organizations who create accounts, we save account information indefinitely to make it easier to order again.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read more in our <a href="https://pubs.cancer.gov/ncipl/privacypolicy.aspx">privacy policy for NCI Publications Locator</a>. For
    more information about privacy and security on the National Cancer Institute website as well as third party sites and applications that NCI uses (for example, Facebook, YouTube), 
you can also visit the overall NCI <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/global/web/policies/privacy">Privacy and Security Policy</a>.

        <h3><a id="security"></a>Is this site secure?</h3>
        <p>
            Our site is secure. Your login, and our reports, are 
    encrypted, which means that no one else can read information as it is sent over the 
    Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can be sure that you are on our secure site by checking that the website address 
        starts with https://pubs.cancer.gov/. You 
        can also look for a lock icon in the address bar in most browsers.
